# PiDrive

A Python package to provide a unified interface to control and retrieve sensor data from supported hardware connected to a Raspberry Pi.
Currently working to support the [SunFounder PiCar-V v2](https://www.sunfounder.com/smart-video-car-kit-v2-0.html).
Pull requests welcome for other boards and setups.
The interface is subject to change for now.

This package was created as a part of my effort to make a homemade self driving car.
